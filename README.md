Kaggle Competition Solution: Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

This notebook is my analysis for a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

For each fullVisitorId in the test set, we should predict the natural log of their total revenue in PredictedLogRevenue, noting that one customer may have number of transactions in data.

This notebook is created using: Python, json, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sickitlearn, LightGBM Regression
